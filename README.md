# VR Sunny Skies

## Overview
VR Sunny Skies is a vision therapy program designed to improve various visual skills through interactive exercises in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The project aims to address the growing need for vision care, particularly in combating issues such as eye strain and reduced peripheral vision caused by prolonged computer use.

This VR application provides a comprehensive suite of vision training exercises, combining proven methods with the immersive capabilities of VR.

## Why Vision Therapy?
Vision therapy is crucial because:
- Vision provides approximately 80% of all sensory input.
- Many individuals neglect proper vision care, leading to conditions such as eye strain and reduced visual flexibility.
- Vision therapy can enhance visual coordination, peripheral perception, hand-eye coordination, and resistance to visual stress.

## Key Features
1. **Comprehensive Vision Therapy**
   - Incorporates 5 popular and effective vision therapy exercises.
   - Each task focuses on improving different visual skills.
   - Designed to be completed within 10 minutes.

2. **Interactive Modes**
   - **Normal Mode**: Users progress through all exercises sequentially.
   - **Directed Mode**: Provides step-by-step instructions for each task.

3. **Performance Feedback**
   - Real-time performance tracking and feedback for each exercise.
   - Metrics such as accuracy, reaction time, and task completion scores are displayed.

## Exercises
The program includes the following tasks:
1. **Eye-Tracking**
   - Follow a moving object with your eyes while keeping your head still.
   - Enhances visual focus and tracking ability.

2. **Brock String**
   - Utilize a string with colored balls to improve depth perception and convergence.

3. **Eye-Ergo**
   - Use a horizontal tube with a ball to practice visual ergonomics and spatial awareness.

4. **Precision Hand-Eye Coordination**
   - Place your finger on the spot where a dot appeared and compare your accuracy.

5. **Visual Memory**
   - Arrange objects based on their original placement after they disappear.

## Design and Interaction
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Accessible main menu with clear navigation to each mode and task.
- **User-Friendly Controls**: Designed for VR controllers with clear instructions provided in Directed Mode.
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Visual and audio cues for guidance and performance improvement.

## User Study
A user study was conducted with the following outcomes:
- Positive feedback on exercise variety and immersion.
- Suggestions to improve controller instructions and adjust task durations.
- Average performance metrics:
  - **Task 4 (Precision Hand-Eye Coordination)**: 6.5 cm average distance.
  - **Task 5 (Visual Memory)**: 12.3 cm average distance.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporation of eye-tracking hardware for enhanced feedback and accuracy.
- Improved task balancing based on user feedback.
- Additional exercises to address more vision therapy needs.
